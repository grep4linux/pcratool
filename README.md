## Pacemaker Cluster Report Analysis Tool

This project will require significant parsing and analysis of various log files and configuration files to provide a holistic view of the cluster's health and state.
Here is a breakdown of the milestones you've set, along with some key considerations for each phase.

# Application Requirements Completion
This is the foundation of your project. Before you start coding, you need to clearly define what the application should do.
Define the scope: What specific problems will this tool solve for a cluster administrator? Will it provide a single, easy-to-read summary, or will it allow for detailed, interactive drilling down into specific events?

# Identify key analysis points: 
Based on the files you've listed, the tool should be able to identify:
Resource status: Which resources are running, stopped, or failed? Where are they located?
Cluster membership: Which nodes are online, offline, or partitioned?
SBD status: Is SBD synchronized? Are there split-brain issues?
Quorum status: Does the cluster have quorum? What's the state of SBD fencing?
Event correlation: Link an event in events.txt to a specific log entry in ha-log.txt or pacemaker.log?
Determine output format: How will the results be presented? 
Creates JSON files for analysis
Writes output in markdown to be compiled into docx, html, and pdf with SUSE branding.

Analysis.txt
Parse and analyze the following node files for each node in the cluster report:
./<node>/journal.log
./<node>/ha-log.txt
./<node>/ha-log.txt.info
./<node>/drbd.conf
./<node>/drbd.d/global_common.conf
./<node>/dlm_dump.txt
./<node>/ocfs2.txt
./<node>/permissions.txt
./<node>/cib.xml
./<node>/sbd

./<node>/RUNNING
./<node>/crm_verify.txt
./<node>/sysstats.txt
./<node>/time.txt
./<node>/messages

./<node>/pacemaker.log.info
./<node>/profiles.yml
./<node>/profiles.yml.info
./<node>/crm.conf
./<node>/crm.conf.info
./<node>/events.txt
Data structures: Create a data model that can hold the parsed information in a structured way. This will be crucial for the analysis phase. For example, a Node object might contain properties for its status, resources, sbd_state, etc.
Initial analysis logic: Implement basic checks and a simple report generation. For example, a function that reads crm_mon.txt and reports if any resources are not started.

# Web Interface (by Nov 15)
This milestone focuses on presenting the data in a more user-friendly way. The web interface will consume the data from your analysis engine and display it visually.
Choose a framework: Select a web framework (e.g., Flask) that will handle the front-end and back-end logic.
Design the UI: Plan a layout that is intuitive for a cluster administrator. A dashboard view with high-level summaries and a drill-down option for detailed logs and resource information would be effective.
API integration: Should the web interface need an API to communicate with the analysis engine. The analysis tool will act as the data source, and the web interface will be the consumer.

# Containerized (by Nov 30)
Making the application containerized (e.g., using podman) will greatly simplify deployment and portability.
Create a Dockerfile: Define a Dockerfile that specifies the necessary dependencies and instructions to build your application image.
Isolate dependencies: Ensure all required libraries and tools are included in the container image, so the application can run in any environment without external dependencies.
Create a startup script: Write a script that can be executed when the container starts. This script should launch your analysis engine and the web server.

# Beta Release with Container (by Dec 1)
This is the first end-to-end version of your application. The container should contain both the analysis engine and the web interface, ready for testing.
User testing: Gather feedback from a small group of users. This is critical for identifying bugs, usability issues, and missing features.
Bug fixes: Address any issues reported during the beta testing phase.
Documentation: Start writing user documentation, including how to set up and run the container, and how to interpret the results.

# Release Candidate (by Dec 15)
The final step before the official launch. The application should be stable, well-documented, and ready for production use.
Final polish: Refine the user interface, improve the wording in the analysis reports, and ensure the code is clean and well-commented.
Performance testing: Verify that the application can handle large cluster report files without significant performance degradation.
Final documentation: Complete all user guides, API references, and developer documentation.
